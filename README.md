Hi,

We're looking for someone to make a scraper that does the following:

1. Opens image links
2. Downloads those images.

The links you'll be opening will be from Google Photos and look like this: https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114598947622868520820

If you click on that link, you'll notice there's 21 total photos that this account contributed. We'd like to open each image link and download those images.

The first one for example would be: https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxUekHo8nxsPswEtbd8JPRn0zFs2SZMBjxbY6n=w1200-h642-p-k-no

The second would be: https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPq2uX3ctuwlmN7WhXmrXIXMGrOhMI115xmonO8=w1200-h969-p-k-no.

Etc.

Both of these images are attached for your reference.

Ideally, all we would have to do is put the Google photos link in the scraper, and have it export files after.

Thanks,
Max
